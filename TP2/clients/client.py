        and initiates the task execution process. It also starts threads for monitoring and Alertflow if the task 
        configuration defines alert conditions.

        The function performs the following steps:
            1. Combines task sequences into a single JSON string.
            2. Converts the JSON string into a Python dictionary.
            3. Parses the task details and creates a Task object using the task ID.
            4. If the task has Alertflow conditions defined, establishes a TCP connection to the server.
            5. Starts the execution thread to run the task.
            6. If Alertflow conditions are set, starts a separate thread for monitoring the task and sending alerts.

        It handles different types of messages based on the `messageType` field in the received datagram. 
        Specifically, it:
            - Parses the received data to extract the relevant message content.
            - Processes the datagram based on its message type (e.g., `0`, `1`, or `4`).

        Returns:
            `None`: The function does not return any value but performs processing and manages internal state.

        Message Types:
